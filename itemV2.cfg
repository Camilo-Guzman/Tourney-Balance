Tourney Balance Testing is a balance mod for Vermintide 2 high difficulty modded gameplay.

[h1]Functionality[/h1]
Tourney Balance aims to rebalance many classes and weapons by nerfing overperformers and buffing weaker or lesser used options while improving variety and choice for players.
Despite numerous adjustments to numbers and values, the goal is to stay as close to the feel of the official game balance as possible so that play styles and the original design intention are retained.

Tourney Balance (TB) mostly focuses on balancing around the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1835393505]Cataclysm 3 Deathwish[/url] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1619024877]Onslaught[/url] (C3DWONS) difficulty  and its higher difficulty versions, such as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2179403386]C3DWONS+[/url] and C3DW [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2559718905]Dutch Spice[/url].
The original intention of Tourney Balance is to be the base line for the various tourneys that are held in the modded realm, such as the Onslaught Series.
